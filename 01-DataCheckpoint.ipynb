    "Based on season-level data from the NBA, is player height (in inches) associated with any measures of on-court production–specifically in the context of Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and field goals made (FGM), after controlling for other factors such as minutes played, age/experience, weight, or wingspan (or ranked alternately–wingspan:height ratio)? When regressing both the correlation and multiple regression models, is there any model in which the height–perfrormance relationship becomes attenuated depending on positional group (guard/forward/center) or season (e.g., through interaction terms, “season” effects)?"

    "Basketball performance reflects both learned skill (shooting, decision making) and physical constraints (reach, mass, speed). Because the NBA systematically records player measurements and season level box-score outcomes, it provides a strong setting for testing whether **height is associated with performance** and whether that association differs by **position**, where roles and typical body types differ (e.g., rim protection vs. playmaking). Prior work on lineups and “small-ball” strategy supports the idea that the value of body size is **context dependent**, motivating our decision to analyze results **within positions** rather than assuming one global height–performance relationship. <sup>[5](#fn5)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "A key challenge is operationalizing “achievement” in a way that is measurable and comparable across players and seasons. We will use **Player Efficiency Rating (PER)** as our **primary outcome** because it is a widely used, per-minute composite of box-score production normalized to a league average value (≈15). However, PER is not a complete measure of total value: it is **box-score based** and is commonly criticized for **under-representing defense** beyond steals/blocks/rebounds, ignoring off-ball defense and matchup effects, and potentially over-rewarding certain offensive box-score patterns. Because of these limitations, we treat PER as a convenient summary, not a definitive “true value”, and will also report **secondary outcomes** (points, rebounds, assists per game) to show *how* any height association manifests across different skill domains and roles. <sup>[6](#fn6)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond height alone, prior work suggests that reach related measures especially **wingspan relative to height** can matter for basketball outcomes. For example, reporting on research published in the *Journal of Anthropology of Sport and Physical Education*, a UC Berkeley news summary describes evidence that arm-length-to-height proportions are associated with elite athletic success in the NBA, suggesting that “functional length” may matter beyond listed height. <sup>[7](#fn7)</sup> Complementing this, sport analytics work focusing on wingspan reports potential tradeoffs: longer wingspans may support defensive impact while being linked to reduced shooting accuracy in some analyses, typically evaluated using **regression-style modeling** (i.e., modeling performance outcomes as a function of wingspan while controlling for other factors). <sup>[8](#fn8)</sup> These findings directly shape our project direction: if height effects weaken after controlling for role/position, wingspan (or wingspan-to-height ratio) may better capture “usable reach” relevant to rebounding/defense—so we will include wingspan when available and explicitly acknowledge it as a potential confound or alternative predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relatedly, draft combine research demonstrates that anthropometric variables differ systematically by position and can be associated with selection outcomes, often using group comparisons and predictive modeling to evaluate discriminative factors. For instance, research on NBA Draft Combine participants identifies which anthropometric and fitness measures best distinguish draft outcomes across positions. <sup>[9](#fn9)</sup> While draft status is not the same as NBA on-court production, this literature reinforces two points that matter for our modeling plan: (1) anthropometrics are intertwined with positional role and selection processes, and (2) any “height effect” should be tested with **controls** and **position-stratified analysis** to reduce misleading aggregate conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, prior work in this area commonly relies on **correlation** and **multivariable regression** frameworks to quantify associations between physical traits and outcomes (e.g., Pearson correlations for bivariate relationships; linear regression to control for confounds). Because our research question centers on whether the height–performance relationship is **position-dependent**, we will extend the typical approach by explicitly testing a **Height × Position interaction** in a regression model, alongside controls such as minutes played and age/experience when available. This allows us to distinguish (a) overall associations from (b) role-specific patterns—aligning our method directly with what prior work suggests, while addressing the common limitation that many analyses either do not stratify by position or do not formally test whether relationships differ across roles.\n",

    "We hypothesize that the height of NBA players (in inches) will have an overall positive association with PER (our primary performance metric), but that this relationship will be position-dependent. Specifically, we expect the height–PER association to be strongest for centers, moderate for forwards, and weak or near-zero for guards, since height is more directly tied to interior roles (e.g., rebounding and rim protection) than perimeter roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our secondary outcomes, we predict height will be positively associated with rebounds per game (RPG) most strongly among centers and forwards, weakly associated with points per game (PPG), and negatively or near-zero associated with assists per game (APG), particularly among guards where playmaking is less height-dependent.\n",

The height, position and PER data can be use to analyze whether the relation between player height and on-court performance vary by their position. This dataset doesn't require any request or permission to use. It contains large amounts of NBA players' height and weight data, which can require some filtering to use.\n",
    "  - This dataset includes players' stats since 1950s, which means that many of the older players data will probably need to be filter out as the related match data is too old and likely unavailable for further analysis, and the time range and data of matches and players from 1950s to current will be too much for the data analysis. Many of the older players in the dataset have many missing data for some of the variables, because some of the rules related to these variables are not yet introduced during their time playing in NBA, we will need to drop/ignore these values for the analysis later on. Also, since the datasets are separated into different csv files, which includes the stats such as position and PER separated from players height and weight, we will need to combined the data in order to be use for the project later.\n",

The data of players' position and field goal percentage, etc. can help us analyze the players performances and find out about the correlations between the players' height and their on-court performances, as well as in relations to their position. This dataset doesn't require any request or permission to use, it's intended for education use. It includes many useful data of NBA players ranging across several years.\n",

    "This project uses publicly available NBA player statistics and does not include any private or sensitive personal information. Since the data come from official league sources and public databases, issues related to informed consent and personal privacy are minimal. However, there are still several ethical considerations in how we define performance and interpret our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create a composite performance index using standardized values of PER, points per game, rebounds per game, and assists per game. Although this helps combine different performance metrics into one measure, assigning equal weight to these variables is a subjective choice. Different positions in basketball naturally emphasize different skills, so some players may be advantaged or disadvantaged depending on how the index is constructed. In addition, PER itself has known limitations and may not fully represent defensive contributions or team impact. Therefore, our performance index should be understood as an approximation rather than a complete measure of player value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, our regression analysis assumes a linear relationship between height and the constructed performance index. This may oversimplify the true relationship. There may be nonlinear patterns or interaction effects between height and position that are not fully captured in our model. In addition, other factors such as team role, experience, or injuries are not included in the dataset, which may introduce omitted variable bias. For this reason, our findings describe statistical associations rather than causal conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, there is a possibility of unintended interpretation. A statistical relationship between height and performance does not imply that taller players are inherently superior. Our analysis is exploratory and academic in nature, and we will be careful not to make deterministic or discriminatory claims based on physical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we recognize that quantitative statistics cannot capture qualitative aspects of basketball, such as leadership, communication, or defensive positioning. These limitations will be clearly acknowledged when presenting our results."

    "* *Division of labor: We will split work fairly across writing, coding, and analysis. Everyone will contribute to both content (writing) and technical work as appropriate.*\n",
    "* *Respect & collaboration: We will communicate respectfully, assume good intent, and give constructive feedback. Disagreements will be discussed calmly with evidence (data/rubric) guiding decisions.*\n",
    "* *Conflict resolution: If a conflict cannot be resolved within the group, we will escalate early (TA/instructor) rather than waiting until deadlines.*\n",
    "* *Accountability: We will post a brief progress update in Discord before each weekly meeting. If someone is blocked, we will ask for help early rather than waiting until the deadline.*"
