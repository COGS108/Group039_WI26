    "We seek to examine: Are NBA players' heights related to on-court performance, and does this relationship vary by position (guard, forward and center)? We’ll take height (inches) as the main predictor, and we want to measure its effect on achievement in terms of performance metrics (e.g., PER and FGM) (or related statistics; i.e. points, rebounds, assists). We will contrast how the height–achievement relationship applies across roles within position group to examine role specificity of the pattern. We will control for such potential confounds as weight, age/experience, minutes played, and wingspan and see if height still makes a difference. We’ll be using correlation and regression models, and visualizations (like scatterplots with trend lines) to illustrate it’s strength as well as direction of our relationship. The result will be an analytical answer to the question of whether taller players are, in fact, better and whether that is position-dependent."

    "Basketball performance depends on a combination of skill, tactics and physical characteristics, and theNBAis an ideal scenario as player measurements (e.g., height) and performance factors are recorded from several seasons. Because height affects what roles you play (rim protector, rebounder, shot contestor), and because it can vary systematically between positions in leagues, researchers and writers frequently discuss whether taller players really do achieve better outcomes—or if the benefits of being tall lie somewhere that’s mediated by position or how one plays, or even other things like arm length or conditioning. In this work, we examine the role of player height on performance/achievement in NBA players by season and position using basic statistical summaries of performance available for all NBA players. <sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge is defining “achievement” in a measurable and comparable way. Most descriptions rely on a single-number summary that collapses many box-score contributions into an indication of overall impact. A common one that is referred to many times throughout the game now based on Cubs' broadcasts, is Player Efficiency Rating (PER) which takes good and bad stats and wraps them up into a per-minute stat designed to encapsulate efficiency. PER is one of the most widely used statistics in public basketball analytics because it can easily be compared between players and over seasons, but PER is nonetheless a model-based statistic with well-known limitations (e.g., it depends on a weighting scheme and box-score availability). The PER can be employed in our project as one endogenous variable, because it’s an effective cover to the total statistical contribution that is compared with height over various subgroups of players. <sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous work has also shown that anthropometric characteristics and body proportions can be associated with outcomes on the proxy of “success” in the NBA. For example, many studies of body proportions and NBA players report correlations between things like wingspan-to-height ratios and metrics such as draft position, while also making clear that loads of other factors (skill, role, team context) contribute to performance and career outcomes. <sup>[3](#fn3)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also similar works linking anthropometrics with strategy and lineup success. Zhang et al. explore how anthropometric factors can be used both to describe elite basketball lineups and performance patterns (including discussion around “small-ball” and lineup construction) underscoring the point that body size may matter differently based on a team’s deployment of players in relation to their role/s played. This supports our approach of considering results by position (i.e. guard/forward/center) instead of forcing one global relationship between height and achievement. <sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, such questions are often examined in public analytics projects. Sivori’s study on height and free-throw percentage, for instance, presents a case where size is conditionally related to a skill outcome in some non-obvious way — and it serves as a useful textbook illustration of the kind of workflow you’d use to not-quite prove that sort of thing about NBA players. In contrast to that more specific skill-based outcome, our study examines broader types of performance (e.g., PER and potentially scoring-based metrics such as field goals made), and will also examine if the strength of relationships differs by position or season. <sup>[4](#fn4)</sup>\n",

    "We predict a strong correlation between the height of NBA players and on-court performances, and we also predict that this relationship does vary by the position of the NBA players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since many previous studies and results had shown that the height of basketball players has an influence on their on-court performances, and that this influence is also related to the position of the players. For example, article by Tânia Santos describes that using a sample based on 508 NBA players in season 2018/2019 scraped from the NBA Advanced Stats, the height and rebounded balls percentage relationship was examined by using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and revealed a strong correlation coefficient (r=.554, p= 0.000 < 0.05), which indicates that higher the height of the players the greater is the percentage of offensive rebounds. <sup>[5](#fn5)</sup> The article also describes a relationship between the height of the NBA players and their position, as the article also describes that according to the data, center players are more likely to be the tallest than Shooting guards.<sup>[5](#fn5)</sup> These data suggests that there are correlations between the height of a NBA player and their performance, and their position very likely has an influence on this relationship as the players of certain positions tend to be of different heights.\n",

    "> Our project uses publicly available NBA player data collected from official league statistics and public analytics websites. All data were originally collected with appropriate consent and made publicly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We acknowledge that NBA data reflects a highly selective population of elite athletes and may not generalize to broader populations. Additionally, player roles and minutes played may bias performance statistics. We will account for this by controlling for position and minutes played in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset contains no personally identifiable information beyond publicly known player attributes (e.g., height, age). No private or sensitive personal data are used.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We recognize that performance metrics may differ systematically by position and physical attributes. Our analysis explicitly separates players by position to avoid misleading aggregate conclusions.\n",

    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",

    "\n",
    "> No private or sensitive data are included in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",

    ">  Height is a core variable of interest rather than a proxy for protected attributes. We do not use variables intended to approximate sensitive personal characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We assess results separately by player position to avoid unfair comparisons across structurally different roles.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Multiple performance metrics (e.g., PER, points, rebounds) are considered to reduce reliance on any single imperfect measure.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "    This project is purely exploratory and academic in nature. No model will be deployed in a real-world decision-making context, and therefore deployment-related risks are minimal."
